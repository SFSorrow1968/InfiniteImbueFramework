# Modding Workflow (Human Guide)

This project uses a "Router-based" agent workflow to keep context clean.

1. **Main Instructions (The Router)**
   - File: `AGENTS.md` (synced to `GEMINI.md`/`CLAUDE.md`)
   - Role: Directs agents to the right place. Does not contain specific code details.

2. **Secondary Instructions (The Context)**
   - Locations: `_visions/*.md` and `_quirks/*.md`
   - Role: Contains feature-specific architecture, logging rules, and edge cases.
   - *Agents read these ONLY when working on that capability.*

3. **Publishing**
   - Script: `_agent/publish.ps1`
   - Role: Automates building and zipping releases.

*Maintained by agents for humans.*
