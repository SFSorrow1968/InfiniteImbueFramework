# Nexus Mods Description Guidelines

When publishing to Nexus Mods, create two descriptions based on these principles:

## 1. Style
- **Aesthetic**: Use clear formatting, headers, and concise bullet points.
- **Immersive**: Do not break the 4th wall. Treat the mod features as part of the game world where possible.
- **Concise**: Get straight to the point. Users want to know what the mod does, not how it was built.

## 2. Brief Description
- **Limit**: One sentence or a short paragraph (approx. 200 characters).
- **Content**: The high-level "elevator pitch" of the mod.
- **Example**: "Adds Matrix-style slow motion effects triggered by combat events like kills, dismemberment, and parries."

## 3. Detailed Description
- **Structure**:
    - **Features**: Bulleted list of main functionalities.
    - **Usage**: Quick guide on how to use/configure the mod in-game.
    - **Requirements**: Dependencies (e.g., framework mods).
    - **Installation**: Standard install instructions if different from Vortex/Manager.
    - **Credits**: Acknowledgments if applicable.
